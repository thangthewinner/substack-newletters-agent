    Middleware for logging incoming HTTP requests and their responses.

    Logs the request method, URL, client IP, and headers.
    Excludes sensitive headers like Authorization and Cookie.
    as well as the response status code and request duration in milliseconds.
    Exceptions raised during request processing are logged with the full traceback.

    Usage:
        Add this middleware to your FastAPI app:
            app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)

    Attributes:
        logger: Configured logger from `setup_logging`.

        Args:
